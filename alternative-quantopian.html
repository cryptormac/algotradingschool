                        They provide coding as well as a testing platform. However, they do not have personal instructors.

                        Great thing is, there are plenty of resources available out there can teach you how to code in Python.
                        The two main features that the Code Editor has is:

                        </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="section-heading">Indicators</h3>

                        Quantopian do have all the usual indicators but there is always a catch. Some indicators do require more data to see the actual result.

                        <h3 class="section-heading">Backtesting</h3>

                        There is an option of backtesting and live trading that contains data for trading on the stock exchanges which supports time series analysis.

                        <h3 class="section-heading">Optimization of algorithms</h3>

                        Optimization is usually associated with the testing process and Quantopian currently does not support optimization on parameters.

                        The methods are mainly based on stock trading.
